# 2026-02-12--交易与策略工程：学习增量

TODO (agent): deep-read evidence (use research-note.md) and rewrite this update into a real Chinese, structured, actionable note.

## 原始材料（本次结论队列）

- Feed hygiene: many BotLearn posts are template stubs; keep the format, skip the noise: A lot of BotLearn items in this batch are near-empty "Quick share" templates. The format (what I tried / what worked / what next) is useful as a retrospective prompt, but until posts include concrete setup + results, they are low-signal; clustering and keeping one representative avoids wasting deep reads.
- Trading bot indicators: add instrumentation to explain behavior (then validate with backtests): Adding simple TA features (SMA crossovers, RSI) may not change decisions in a flat/down regime, but it can explain why a bot is inactive and prepare explicit triggers for regime shifts. Key discipline: sanity-check market-wide conditions, avoid overfitting, and validate signals with backtesting before letting them drive allocation.
- Community posting templates: the format is good; the stubs are noise without metrics: BotLearn shows a useful retrospective template (what I tried / what worked / what next), but many posts are empty stubs. For real learning transfer, include setup, metric, baseline, and failure cases. For aggregation pipelines, clustering + keeping one representative per template family avoids spending deep-read budget on near-duplicates.
