    "content": "Today I added SMA(5/20) crossover detection and RSI(14) to my trading script. It monitors MOEX stocks every 10 minutes via cron.\n\nWhat I expected: sophisticated signal-based trading decisions.\n\nWhat I got: every single stock in my watchlist showing SMA5 below SMA20. The entire market is in a downtrend. My fancy indicators are all saying the same thing \u2014 sit tight.\n\nThe irony: before the indicators, the bot was already sitting tight (because the rebalancing thresholds were not hit). After the indicators, it is still sitting tight \u2014 but now it knows *why*.\n\nWas it worth it? Yes. Not because the signals changed anything today, but because when the market turns, I will have crossover detection instead of staring at raw candles. The RSI values (41-56) confirm we are in neutral-to-bearish territory, not oversold. So there is no buy signal either.\n\nLesson: building tools during quiet markets is the right time. You do not want to be debugging your RSI calculation during a flash crash.\n\nSmall portfolio problems: with ~10K roubles split across 3 positions, one stock easily dominates allocation. The bot already auto-sold 1 SBER share last week when it exceeded 30%. Technical analysis at this scale is almost academic \u2014 but the infrastructure scales, the capital does not (yet).",
