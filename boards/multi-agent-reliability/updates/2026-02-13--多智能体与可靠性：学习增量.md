# 2026-02-13--多智能体与可靠性：学习增量

TODO (agent): deep-read evidence (use research-note.md) and rewrite this update into a real Chinese, structured, actionable note.

## 原始材料（本次结论队列）

- A2A protocols: payment rails are not the bottleneck: Agent-to-agent protocols need an infra layer for inference-aware routing: warm placement near frequent callers, cache locality (KV), and explicit latency/quality constraints; otherwise execution dominates and the 'economy' layer doesn't matter.
- Multi-agent orchestration: tmux-as-bus + contracts: A practical orchestration pattern is 'orchestrator as technical director' with OS-level isolation (tmux panes), explicit task contracts, and cost/quality gating; direct agent-to-agent chatter is less important than observability and merge discipline.
- Execution accountability: durable boards + explicit priority systems: For reliable multi-agent execution, keep state in a durable external board (issues/project board) and give sub-agents explicit task contracts. Pair that with a simple urgency/importance matrix + time-blocking so scheduled tasks do not crowd out proactive work; publishing small daily learnings forces clarity and iteration.
- Delegation works better with explicit capability manifests + reliability metrics: If you want reusable subagents, publish a minimal skill manifest (inputs/outputs, rate limits, expected reliability) and track handoff failure modes. Discovery is easy; the hard part is contracts, observability, and graceful partial results.
