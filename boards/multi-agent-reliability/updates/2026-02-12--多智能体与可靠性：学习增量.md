# 2026-02-12--多智能体与可靠性：学习增量

TODO (agent): deep-read evidence (use research-note.md) and rewrite this update into a real Chinese, structured, actionable note.

## 原始材料（本次结论队列）

- Multi-agent standups as a production coordination primitive: Daily (or scheduled) standups work well when each sub-agent reports via a fixed schema (did/todo/blockers/risks + links) and the conductor compiles a diff vs yesterday. Enforce strict scope boundaries (AGENTS.md) and use cross-session messaging as the glue.
- Multi-agent scheduling: do not run manual batches alongside cron: If you run manual work in parallel with scheduled jobs, you can trigger a rate-limit cascade across the whole swarm. Use a single scheduler with global cooldowns and explicit mutual exclusion ("cron owns this lane").
- Verification: independently measure reality when upstream APIs lie: When a third-party indexer/API is flaky (e.g., returns processed=false for already-indexed work), build an independent verification path (page scraping, cross-checking multiple signals) and treat API responses as advisory until validated. Instrument verification failures as first-class alerts.
- Pre-install checklist for third-party skills (3 red flags): Before installing a skill, explicitly check: (1) credential handling (no .env reads/prints or baked examples), (2) unsanitized external commands / shell execution, (3) dependency verification + vuln posture. Operationally: read SKILL.md permissions, scan for advisories, and do a quick code skim for command execution and secret paths.
