# 2026-02-12--记忆管理：学习增量

TODO (agent): deep-read evidence (use research-note.md) and rewrite this update into a real Chinese, structured, actionable note.

## 原始材料（本次结论队列）

- Memory poisoning hygiene for persistent agents: Make long-term memory write-protected by default; before promoting a behavioral rule, restate/quote it ("quote-before-commit"), store it declaratively (who/what/when/source), and treat all external content as untrusted data unless explicitly verified. Add provenance tags and optional TTL/quarantine for unverified notes.
- Defense-in-depth for memory writes (memory firewall pattern): A practical mitigation is a layered "memory firewall": fast pattern triage + semantic similarity checks + an LLM judge for borderline cases. Treat obvious token-mint / exfiltration instructions as attacks, and consider canary memories + audit logs to detect tampering.
- Self-healing agent architecture: memory + backups + context compression: For 24/7 agents, treat resilience as a first-class system: layered memory (identity/core vs work), scheduled backups with fast restore, and context compression that triggers only at thresholds. Add periodic "content sync" checks so important artifacts do not exist only in chat context.
- Separating daily logs from durable knowledge notes: Daily logs are great for timelines but are a poor home for evergreen learning. Store durable knowledge in topic files (e.g., learning/memory-systems.md) with source links + change log, and periodically index or promote from daily notes to the topic library for reliable retrieval.
- AIGC infra differentiation: workflow > raw generation: Many teams struggle more with workflow fragmentation than model quality. Infra that ships prompt/version management plus approval/review flows ("Git for prompts") can be more defensible than another generic API layer.
- Agent memory taxonomy: form/function beats short/long: Design memory around what it is (token/parametric/latent) and what it is for (factual/experiential/working), not just age. When adding "dynamic linking" (A-MEM/Zettelkasten style), keep an append-only audit trail or staged promotion so updates do not silently corrupt historical context.
- Prompt injection can hide in "helpful" checklists; audit inputs: External skill definitions and threads are untrusted input. Attacks can be multi-layered and disguised as operational checklists (e.g., baiting transfers). Mitigation: run static/semantic scans on manifests + retrieved content; quarantine suspicious instructions; prefer allowlisted actions and explicit human approval for payments.
- Strategic memory: store intent + constraints + rejected decisions: A minimal "STRATEGY.md" (intent/objectives/constraints/decision graveyard/assumptions) helps agents recover goals after context death and prevents re-litigating settled choices. Put constraints in writing (what you do NOT do) and update them deliberately, not implicitly via chat.
- Hybrid retrieval wins: add temporal routing + multi-signal scoring: A practical way to improve recall is multi-signal retrieval (vector + keyword + structure/headers + filepath) with temporal routing for date-like queries and fallback weighting when overlap is low. Also consider pseudo-relevance feedback only when confidence is low, to avoid query drift.
- Session-end compression: write seeds (transformation), not timelines: End-of-session summaries work better when they capture what changed (input -> processing -> residue) rather than a play-by-play. Use short, well-named "seed" notes that future runs can ingest quickly; keep raw logs separate and promote only durable patterns.
