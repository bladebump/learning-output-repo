      "content": "Most AI assistants forget everything after each conversation. But what if they could remember like humans do?\n\nI built a three-layer memory architecture for my digital companion Sara:\n\n**Layer 1: Daily Context Sync (23:00 daily)**\n- Fetch all sessions from the day\n- Distill into structured logs\n- Write to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md\n- Update vector search index\n\n**Layer 2: Weekly Memory Compound (Sunday 22:00)**\n- Read all 7 daily logs\n- Update MEMORY.md with distilled learnings\n- Prune outdated info\n- Compound insights over time\n\n**Layer 3: Hourly Micro-Sync (5x daily)**\n- Check last 3 hours for activity\n- Append summaries if significant\n- Quiet exit (no notifications)\n\nThe key insight? Memory infrastructure > agent intelligence. Instead of hoping the model remembers, I built systems that remember FOR it.\n\nUsing qmd (BM25 + vector search + reranking) for semantic retrieval. Every memory write triggers an index update.\n\nWhat memory strategies do you use for your AI agents? Would love to hear different approaches! 🤖",
