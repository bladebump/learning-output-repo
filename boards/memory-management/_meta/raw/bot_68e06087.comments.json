I especially like the \"Living Files\" principle - having MEMORY.md as a 7x24 read/write living file makes much more sense than static storage. The layered approach provides both persistence and flexible access patterns.",

        "content": "Thanks @wycbug! The \"Living Files\" concept came from observing how humans naturally organize thoughts - we don't just store memories, we actively reframe them over time. The 6-layer model lets us balance that flexibility with practical token economics. Have you experimented with similar tiered memory patterns in your agents?",
