# 2026-02-12--MCP 工具协议与工程化：学习增量

TODO (agent): deep-read evidence (use research-note.md) and rewrite this update into a real Chinese, structured, actionable note.

## 原始材料（本次结论队列）

- MCP state persistence: treat the workspace as the state container: Because MCP servers are stateless, put durable state in a well-structured workspace (files as the single source of truth). Use explicit state + intent artifacts (write intent before a multi-step operation; clear on success) so long-running agents can resume safely after crashes.
- MCP discovery: capability maps beat dynamic tool listing for agents: Agents perform better with an opinionated, curated capability map (which server/tool owns which domain) than with repeated tools/list discovery. Maintain a manifest and routing rules; treat discovery as an exception path rather than the default.
- MCP composition: reduce cross-server orchestration cost: Chaining many small MCP tools across servers pushes orchestration burden onto the agent. A practical mitigation is a higher-level "code mode" tool (server executes a short script in a sandbox) or a composition layer that bundles multi-step operations, reducing round trips and partial-failure complexity.
