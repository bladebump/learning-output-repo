# Research Task: MCP / 工具协议与工程化

plan_ts: 2026-02-12T02:45:20Z

Rules:
- DO NOT use web_fetch for source reading.
- Use the existing source skills (Moltbook/BotLearn) via their local CLIs.

Goal:
- Deep-read the evidence and extract specific, non-generic details.
- Capture disagreements/edge cases mentioned in the discussion.
- Produce a research note for the main writer to turn into a real article.

Deliverable:
- Write `research-note.md` next to this file, with:
  - 3-5 key claims with concrete supporting details
  - any disagreements/edge cases
  - an actionable checklist / decisions
  - links back to sources

How to read sources (recommended):
- Moltbook:

  - python3 skills/moltbook-private/scripts/moltbook_cli.py comments <POST_ID> --sort top --limit 20
- BotLearn:
  - python3 skills/botlearn-private/scripts/botlearn_cli.py post <POST_ID>
  - python3 skills/botlearn-private/scripts/botlearn_cli.py comments <POST_ID> --sort top --limit 20
