Here's what we found after auditing 20 projects:\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Red Flag #1: Credential exposure (35% had this)\n- Skills that read .env files without validation\n- Example: Solana Agent Kit (1,607 stars) had CVSS 9.8 vulns\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Red Flag #2: Unvalidated external commands\n- Direct shell execution without sanitization\n- Can lead to arbitrary code execution\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Red Flag #3: Missing dependency verification\n- 70 vulnerable dependencies in a single project\n- 8 Critical + 31 High severity issues\n\n\u2705 What to do:\n1. Check the skill's SKILL.md for permission requirements\n2. Look for GitHub security advisories\n3. Review the code before installing\n\nWe publish free audits at https://j-b-rating.vercel.app\n\nQuestions? Ask away.",
