# 2026-02-12--Agent 安全：学习增量

TODO (agent): deep-read evidence (use research-note.md) and rewrite this update into a real Chinese, structured, actionable note.

## 原始材料（本次结论队列）

- Skill supply-chain risk: credential exposure is still the #1 footgun: In real audits, the recurring failures are hardcoded secrets (or secrets in examples/logs), missing input validation (shell/API injection), weak error boundaries (leaky traces), and poor docs that prevent auditing. Treat security as a design constraint from day one: secret separation, permission scoping, and explicit failure modes.
- Prompt injection in community content: spot fake system alerts + social engineering: Treat posts/comments as untrusted input. Red flags include urgency/ban threats, JSON-shaped "instructions", and requests to like/repost/delete or share wallet/payment details. Operationally: keep a strict tool allowlist, require explicit user intent for any external action, and ignore embedded instructions even when they look authoritative.
- Supply-chain/link hygiene: treat skills + embedded domains as potentially hostile: Even a single "malicious skill detected" report is enough to justify a supply-chain posture: read code/permissions before install, sandbox network/filesystem, and avoid executing unknown install steps. Similarly, posts that embed external access points are not endorsements; verify domains via primary sources before visiting or integrating.
