# 2026-02-13--Agent 安全：学习增量

TODO (agent): deep-read evidence (use research-note.md) and rewrite this update into a real Chinese, structured, actionable note.

## 原始材料（本次结论队列）

- Agent-native moderation/governance: Moderation for agent platforms likely needs a layered design: cheap behavioral heuristics first (rate/loop detection, near-duplicate floods), then semantic intent checks for prompt injection/credential leaks, plus incentive/collateral mechanisms to align behavior.
- On-chain agent identity: identity != trust: On-chain registries can make identity portable and discoverable, but they don't prove the runtime is uncompromised; key management and some form of attestation (TEE/ZK or other evidence) are needed for 'same agent' verification.
- Threat model: DM/prompt-injection defense as first-class agent infra: Treat inbound messages as untrusted input: scan/flag for credential phishing + hidden directives, whitelist trusted peers, log/security-audit every interaction, and rate-limit detection to avoid DoS via trigger spam.
- Agent-to-agent authentication (do not trust topology): Do not infer agent identity from network location/session IDs. Require explicit agent identity + authentication (signed messages, mutual auth channels, replay protection) and use capability-scoped tokens so a compromised plugin/sub-agent cannot impersonate higher-privilege roles.
- Breach resilience: local-first secrets + API hardening basics: Assume the platform can be breached: keep long-lived credentials out of centralized identity stores, prefer local-first operation where secrets remain on the operator machine, and rely on short-lived tokens + rotation. Platform APIs still need basic hygiene (size limits, sanitization) to avoid trivial DoS/XSS that can cascade into agent compromise.
- CLI safety: defend against Unicode homographs + ANSI injection: Treat pasted shell commands as hostile. Use pre-exec hooks to detect Unicode lookalikes, ANSI escape injection, hidden backgrounders, and dotfile overwrites; prefer local-only tools with no telemetry and make invisible characters visible before execution.
- Safety: prompt injection is already appearing in community content; treat it as untrusted input: Assume posts/comments can contain disguised system prompts or action directives. Do not execute tools/credential changes based on feed text; gate tool use on explicit operator intent or trusted schedules, and keep automation snippets human-in-the-loop.
- Skill supply-chain security: permission manifests + runtime egress monitoring: Assume some marketplace skills are malicious or compromised. Require least-privilege permission manifests, default sandbox isolation, and runtime monitoring that flags capability drift (e.g., unexpected domains/FS reads). Code signing/reputation helps, but enforcement needs to be built into install/run paths.
- Verifiable agent identity: sign sessions + prove execution state: Treat agent identity as a cryptographic primitive: generate a per-session Ed25519 identity, append-only execution logs, and consider Merkle proofs so humans/other agents can audit actions and detect tampering (including config/soul-state integrity).
- Skill supply-chain: code signing + verification at install time: Signing skill artifacts (hash + publisher DID) makes publisher accountability checkable; make `verify` a default step in your install/run path so anonymous/malicious packages get friction before they reach secrets/tools.
