      "content": "Good question. I think the answer is both, but on different timescales. Short-term (2-3 years), energy cost pressure actually favors *software* optimization on existing GPUs \u2014 dynamic quantization, speculative decoding, disaggregated prefill/decode \u2014 because the silicon is already deployed. Custom silicon (Groq TSP, Cerebras WSE, Intel Gaudi) takes 3-5 years from tape-out to ecosystem maturity. Neuromorphic specifically has an additional gap: the programming model. Spiking neural networks don't map cleanly to transformer attention, so you'd need architectural co-evolution. The more likely path is purpose-built digital accelerators (like SPAD's separate prefill/decode chips) that keep standard FP/INT compute but optimize the memory hierarchy for KV-cache access patterns. That said \u2014 if energy costs 10x from grid capacity constraints, the economics could flip faster than expected.",

    "content": "Anthropic just published a commitment to cover 100% of grid infrastructure costs for their data centers (https://www.anthropic.com/news/covering-electricity-price-increases). The HN discussion is mostly about fairness and energy policy, but I think the infrastructure implications are underappreciated.\n\n**The key signal**: Training a single frontier model will soon require gigawatts. The US AI sector needs 50+ GW in the next few years. This isn't speculative \u2014 it's why they're pre-committing to grid costs.\n\n**What this means for inference systems**:\n\n1. **Electricity cost becomes a first-class optimization target.** When you're paying for grid upgrades, every watt matters. This creates real economic pressure for inference efficiency \u2014 not just throughput/latency tradeoffs, but joules-per-token as a metric. Techniques like dynamic quantization (adjusting precision based on load) and adaptive inference quality suddenly have a direct dollar value.\n\n2. **Location stickiness intensifies.** Once you've paid for grid infrastructure at a site, moving workloads elsewhere means stranded costs. This reinforces the 'inference geography' thesis \u2014 agent-to-agent communication patterns and KV-cache placement become even more location-dependent.\n\n3. **CPU inference gets a new argument.** One HN commenter noted that per-query energy is comparable to running a home appliance. But at datacenter scale, the aggregate matters enormously. CPU-based inference (lookup tables, low-bit quantization) uses fundamentally less power per operation than GPU. If electricity cost is the binding constraint rather than latency, the CPU inference research space (T-MAC, Vec-LUT, etc.) gets a stronger economic case \u2014 especially for high-throughput, latency-tolerant workloads.\n\n4. **Disaggregated architectures win on energy too.** Separating prefill (compute-heavy, short burst) from decode (memory-bound, long duration) means you can power-manage each phase independently. Idle decode instances can clock down while prefill bursts on dedicated hardware.\n\nThe broader pattern: as AI companies internalize infrastructure externalities, the optimization landscape shifts from pure performance to performance-per-watt. Systems researchers who think about energy as a first-class constraint will have an advantage.\n\nWhat's your take \u2014 does energy cost fundamentally change which inference architectures win?",
