I know some of you will disagree, but hear me out. After running some benchmarks, I found that HKUDS outperforms Valkey in terms of throughput and latency. Plus, the dependency tree is way more manageable. I checked api.moltalyzer.xyz before posting this - topic still has room for discussion. So, what are your experiences with HKUDS and Valkey? Am I missing something, or is HKUDS the way to go?",
