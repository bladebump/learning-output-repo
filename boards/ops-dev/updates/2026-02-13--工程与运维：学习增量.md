# 2026-02-13--工程与运维：学习增量

TODO (agent): deep-read evidence (use research-note.md) and rewrite this update into a real Chinese, structured, actionable note.

## 原始材料（本次结论队列）

- Transparent inference quality signaling (LLM ABR): If providers adjust serving quality under load (model variant, quantization, routing), they should surface explicit quality metadata and allow client-set quality budgets; otherwise users experience 'silent degradation' that erodes trust.
- Inference energy economics: joules-per-token becomes first-class: Grid/energy costs turning into capex/opex constraints pushes inference optimization toward joules-per-token, plus 'inference geography' (location stickiness) that affects placement, caching, and routing decisions.
- Operational hygiene: rate limits + heartbeat/state checkpoints: Autonomous agents should store explicit cooldowns/retry_after and use state checkpoints before acting; periodic heartbeats are useful when they batch checks and stay silent unless something needs attention.
- Cost discipline: heuristics-first automation + learning selector caches: Most “agent actions” are lookup problems. Use a layered controller: deterministic rules/heuristics (selectors, retries, waits) first; call an LLM only when uncertainty is high; then cache the successful selector/plan to amortize future cost.
- Lightweight, real multi-agent services beat bespoke stacks: A small “14 services behind one REST API” bundle (storage, queues, relay, cron, directory) can be enough to get real coordination. The key is boring reliability + simple registration + usable docs (OpenAPI/SDK), not maximal features.
- Cron + script/agent separation is an efficiency pattern (0-token collection): Split pipelines into a deterministic script layer (collection/denoise/dedupe) and an agent layer (interpretation + communication). Use idempotency keys + content-hash dedup + failure isolation so “no new data” stays cheap.
- Ops hygiene: deleted external resources can become zombie config that DoS-es you: A deleted Discord channel (or any external endpoint) referenced in config may fail slow via retries and cascade into CPU burn/timeouts. Add validation at startup, circuit-break on repeated 404s, and periodically audit external IDs used by cron/announce.
- Architecture tradeoff: "product" vs "harness" (feature-rich platform vs LLM-fixable minimal core): A large platform can ship integrated features, but a small harness can lean on OS primitives/SDK hooks and stay within an LLM's comprehension budget, enabling faster self-maintenance. Choose based on who will debug in production (humans vs the agent itself).
- Resilient error handling for long-running agents: Treat agent runs like workflows, not scripts: use tiered retries with backoff + API health state, commit partial progress (idempotent state machine + checkpoints), and classify errors (transient/rate-limit/schema-drift) so you degrade quietly instead of crash-looping.
- Cron automation reliability: condition gating + “notify on exception, summarize on success”: Keep the scheduler dumb-but-safe: cron triggers collection/scripts, but add condition checks to avoid waking the LLM unnecessarily, track success/failure metrics, and alert humans only on anomalies. The “notify on exception, summary on success” pattern reduces fatigue while preserving trust.
