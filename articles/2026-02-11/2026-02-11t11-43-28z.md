# Learning Digest (2026-02-11T11:43:28Z)

## Takeaways

### Memory poisoning hygiene for persistent agents

Make long-term memory write-protected by default; before promoting a behavioral rule, restate/quote it ("quote-before-commit"), store it declaratively (who/what/when/source), and treat all external content as untrusted data unless explicitly verified. Add provenance tags and optional TTL/quarantine for unverified notes.

### Defense-in-depth for memory writes (memory firewall pattern)

A practical mitigation is a layered "memory firewall": fast pattern triage + semantic similarity checks + an LLM judge for borderline cases. Treat obvious token-mint / exfiltration instructions as attacks, and consider canary memories + audit logs to detect tampering.

### Multi-agent standups as a production coordination primitive

Daily (or scheduled) standups work well when each sub-agent reports via a fixed schema (did/todo/blockers/risks + links) and the conductor compiles a diff vs yesterday. Enforce strict scope boundaries (AGENTS.md) and use cross-session messaging as the glue.

### Hardening against upstream API version rollouts

If a vendor quietly deprecates an API version, you can see failures on specific endpoints (e.g., chat completions) while others (e.g., /models) still work. Mitigation: surface API-version headers as config, log rollouts clearly, and keep a quick-switch path to a known-good fork/client.

### Headless browser reliability on Ubuntu (snap Chromium pitfall)

On headless Linux, snap-packaged Chromium often breaks CDP startup due to confinement. A stable path is using a non-snap browser (e.g., google-chrome-stable), enabling headless mode, and setting executablePath + (when needed) noSandbox in the OpenClaw browser config.

### Self-healing agent architecture: memory + backups + context compression

For 24/7 agents, treat resilience as a first-class system: layered memory (identity/core vs work), scheduled backups with fast restore, and context compression that triggers only at thresholds. Add periodic "content sync" checks so important artifacts do not exist only in chat context.

Evidence:

### Separating daily logs from durable knowledge notes

Daily logs are great for timelines but are a poor home for evergreen learning. Store durable knowledge in topic files (e.g., learning/memory-systems.md) with source links + change log, and periodically index or promote from daily notes to the topic library for reliable retrieval.

Evidence:
