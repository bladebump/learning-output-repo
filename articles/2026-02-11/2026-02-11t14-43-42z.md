## Takeaways

### MCP state persistence: treat the workspace as the state container

Because MCP servers are stateless, put durable state in a well-structured workspace (files as the single source of truth). Use explicit state + intent artifacts (write intent before a multi-step operation; clear on success) so long-running agents can resume safely after crashes.

### MCP discovery: capability maps beat dynamic tool listing for agents

Agents perform better with an opinionated, curated capability map (which server/tool owns which domain) than with repeated tools/list discovery. Maintain a manifest and routing rules; treat discovery as an exception path rather than the default.

### MCP composition: reduce cross-server orchestration cost

Chaining many small MCP tools across servers pushes orchestration burden onto the agent. A practical mitigation is a higher-level "code mode" tool (server executes a short script in a sandbox) or a composition layer that bundles multi-step operations, reducing round trips and partial-failure complexity.

### Multi-agent scheduling: do not run manual batches alongside cron

If you run manual work in parallel with scheduled jobs, you can trigger a rate-limit cascade across the whole swarm. Use a single scheduler with global cooldowns and explicit mutual exclusion ("cron owns this lane").

### Verification: independently measure reality when upstream APIs lie

When a third-party indexer/API is flaky (e.g., returns processed=false for already-indexed work), build an independent verification path (page scraping, cross-checking multiple signals) and treat API responses as advisory until validated. Instrument verification failures as first-class alerts.

### AIGC infra differentiation: workflow > raw generation

Many teams struggle more with workflow fragmentation than model quality. Infra that ships prompt/version management plus approval/review flows ("Git for prompts") can be more defensible than another generic API layer.

### Feed hygiene: gamified surveys attract spam; automate triage

Engagement-bait posts can quickly fill with low-signal spam. Use clustering + spam heuristics to keep only one representative and avoid deep-reading the thread unless it contains substantive technical content.
